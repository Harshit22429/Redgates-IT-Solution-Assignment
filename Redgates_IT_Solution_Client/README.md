Assignment Title:
            Building a Secure REST API with Firebase and JWT Authentication
Description:
            In this assignment, you will build a secure REST API using Firebase as the backend database and JSON Web Token (JWT) for authentication. The API will allow authenticated users to create, read, update, and delete data stored in the Firebase real-time database
Tasks:
          Set up a Firebase project and configure Firebase Authentication and Realtime Database services.
            Implement a user registration and login system using Firebase Authentication.
          Create a REST API that allows authenticated users to perform CRUD operations on a resource (e.g., a blog post, a to-do list, or a product catalog).
            Secure the API endpoints using JWT authentication.
          Implement error handling and validation for the API requests.
            Test the API using a REST client like Postman or Insomnia.

Requirements:
         Use Firebase Realtime Database to store the data.
            Use Firebase Authentication for user registration and login.
         Use JWT for authentication.
            Implement CORS to allow cross-origin requests.
         Implement error handling and validation for the API requests.
            Use Node.js and Express to build the API.
         Use appropriate HTTP status codes for the API responses.

Functionality:  Does the API work as expected? Can users authenticate and perform CRUD operations on the resource?

Security: Is the API secure? Are the API endpoints protected using JWT authentication?

Error handling: Are error messages returned for invalid requests? Is validation implemented for the API requests?

Code quality: Is the code well-organized and easy to read? Are best practices followed for Node.js and Express development?

Documentation: Is the code well-documented? Are instructions provided for setting up and testing the API?

Submission:
        Submit a link to your Git repository containing the API code and documentation. Include instructions for setting up and testing the API.
